<header class="padtop">Videogames as a whole</header>
<section>
Videogames are a form of widespread, virtual recreation that can take the form of numerous different genres, types, and platforms.
They are essentially millions of lines of code and calculations being executed at every second in order to display moving and interactive
content on a display device. This form of gaming is becoming universal as more and more developing countries gain access to technology,
as well as an increasing amount of the older and new generations hopping on board the virtual gaming scene. Videogames have the capability of unifying
humans by allowing us to play with individuals from a distance and with those who come from different cultural and professional backgrounds. All in all, 
they help everyday people relieve themselves of stress, socialise with others online, and even make a career for themselves if they  have a high enough 
skill level and can enter <a href="http://www.lolesports.com/en_AU/" target="_blank">eSports</a> tournaments.

<header>Their evolution</header>
<section>
Though we take stunning graphics and intuitive <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> for granted nowadays, videogames weren't always so robust and clever 
in their humble beginnings. Many of the earliest videogames could only output the most basic of graphics, had an '8-bit sound' instead of a high definition 
library of soundtracks, and often had buggy and fiddley control inputs that didn't always work and involved only mundane and repetitous button combinations 
that got tedious over time. Through innovation and progress over the decades, more realistic elements could be applied to videogames. Advances in computing 
allowed for 3D instead of 2D rendering, more space on a cartridge meant that more information could be stored in it, and therefore allowed for better graphics 
and higher fidelity sound, and lots more. 
</section>

<header>How they help people</header>
<section>
People everyday go through troubling and stressful experiences that can leave them completely drained and out of energy by the end of the day. Whether it be 
work, financial troubles, a loss of a loved one, or things in general being too cumbersome, videogames have been developed as a fallback activity that people
use to relax and relieve themselves of a hard day's work. They also help provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment to a person's life. Knowing in your head
that you still have to go and save the princess or that you have yet to conquer and explore an entire map and complete a dungeon helps distract the mind form 
ordinary, mundane thoughts and provide some spice and diversity to spruce up someone's thoughts. They can also make an introvert or a shy individual break out 
of their shell and become a completely new, outgoing, and confident individual on the online world. On the more practical side of things, new advancements in 
<abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr> technology by Oculus and HTC have opened the doors to development of certain simulators that can be used as a form of 
psychological therapy. Creating a game that simulates being at a great altitude or being on a public transport, and then immersing an individual who has problems 
with either of the two in <abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr>, has been found to be significantly more effective than conventional methods at making their 
fears and irrational thoughts dissapear more quickly.

<header>Their future</header>
<section>
The videogame industry is a booming one, and its growth will not stop at any time soon. Like stated previously, videogames are receiving more and more exposure 
as it becomes a more adopted and widely accepted form of recreation. This means that new jobs will be created in the business and new people with their own talents, 
ideas, and innovations will join the game development scheme and keep advancing the progress at which videogames are developed and made better and better each day. 
New technologies and game development kits introuduced from graphics cards companies <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html" target="_blank">Nvidia</a> and 
<a href="http://www.amd.com/en/home" target="_blank">AMD</a> will help developers make more real and immersive videogames that seem all the more alive. Additionally, 
coupled with the fact that technology gets faster roughly every one and a half years and its affordability becoming better and better as time goes by, more consumers 
will be able to purchase videogames that were once viewed as premium and hard-to-run content, which provides the videogame industry with more money, which in turn allows 
for better videogames to be produced. Overall, this creates a positive feedback loop that is self-sustaining and that is very unlikely to phase out of existence in the 
future.

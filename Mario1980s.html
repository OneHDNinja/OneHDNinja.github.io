<header class="contentpadtop">Nintendo's big break</header>
<section>	
Originally starting out as a company that produced Japanese playing cards in 1889, family-friendly company 
<a href="http://www.nintendo.com.au/" target="_blank">Nintendo</a> has gone on to be one of the three major companies currently competing 
in the console industry, otherwise known as the 'console war.' Prior to the release of the extremely successful Nintendo Entertainment System, 
Nintendo produced handheld devices called 'Game and Watch' starting from 1980 which allowed them to achieve their first big success in the gaming industry.
	<p>	
Game and Watches were handheld electronic devices that drew inspiration from LCD calculators in regards to design and functionality. However, they only had 
one game programmed into them. That game would then be separated into the options 'Game A' and 'Game B,' with the latter being a more difficult, amped up version 
of the standard game. This meant that for every new game you wanted to play, you would have to purchase a totally new Game and Watch device with the new game 
programmed into it - an inconvenience for many collectors today. In total, 43.1 million units were sold; this allowed Nintendo to continue their work in the 
videogame industry and further increase their presence and influence in the market.
	</p>

<header>The Nintendo Entertainment System</header>
<section>
1985 was the ultimate debut for one of the most iconic and distinguished videogame characters to date. Later becoming the front and face of Nintendo, Mario is a 
character that was introduced in Nintendo's hit home console the NES, through Mario's first game Super Mario Bros. a 2D platformer. The NES was Nintendo's attempt 
at introducing a remake of their first home console to the international market, following their Famicom system in 1983 (which had to be recalled some time later 
to due to a malfunctioning component). It was a console that became the host of several of Nintendo's and the game industry's most iconic games such as Metroid, 
The Legend of Zelda, and more.
	<p>
In total, the NES sold 62 million units. 20 million came from Japan, 34 million from North and South America, and the rest being sourced from the rest of the 
world. The NES was defiant in that it was released after the videogame crash of the early 1980s, which featured the burial of millions of copies of inferior, poorly 
developed games (not from Nintendo) in the desert. This sparked many environmental and ethical concerns which in turn, created a stigma around the videogame industry. 
Though many thought the NES would have no staying power in the entertainment indusrty, it proved the world wrong and went on to enrich the childhood of millions of 
people still alive today.

<header>Mario, The Italian Plumber</header>
<section>
Mario was an instant hit character that embedded itself into the hearts of many '80s childeren. Portrayed as a stereotypical Italian plumber wearing blue 
overalls, he was firstseen in Nintendo's Donkey Kong in 1981, with he goal of saving his beloved Princess Toadstool from the evil simian standing atop several 
platforms. After receiving his own game Super Mario Bros. in 1983, the Mario franchise was expanded upon with two numerical sequels, and several spin-off games 
such as Mario Party, Mario Kart, and Paper Mario, all of which did extremely well and remain very popular sub-franchises to date.
	<p>
The first Super Mario Bros. featured eight playable worlds that held four levels each for a total of
thirty-two levels. Each world had its own unique theme, obstacles, and enemies. One world is an underwater environment which features enemy Bloopers that can slowly 
home in on Mario. Levels which follow certain themes include underground levels which have Mario complete dangerous feats of parkour, or speed run levels where Mario 
has to quickly outmanoeuvre a hovering Lakitu throwing Spiny Eggs onto him. However, with Mario's fire powerup and invincibility star, players are able to breeze 
through many of these levels and clear the game in under an hour, a miniscule length of playtime when compared to modern titles which range from needed twenty to one 
hundred hours to complete. All in all, despite the original game's still primative graphics, Super Mario Bros. was inovative in that it gave players of the '80s a 
feeling of variety and something that felt more new and interactive.
